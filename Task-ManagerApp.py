'''
*Problem Description*

The aim of the program is to help the user manage their daily tasks and store these tasks in a simple 
and straightforward manner through the use of a text file. The use of the text file also 
allows for users to rerun the program, without losing the items on their Todo List from the previous run.

The program gives users the option of adding, displaying, editing, removing or clearing ToDo items 
through the use of item numbers that uniquely identify each item.

Functionalities:

- Add an Item Option:
Users will be able to input what item they would like to add to their Todo List.

- Show all Items Option:
Users will be able to view all their items on their Todo List.

- Edit an Item Option:
Users are able to enter in the item number they would like to edit, and their Todo List 
would be updated to reflect that change.

- Remove an Item Option:
Users are able to enter in the item number they would like to remove, and that item would be removed from 
their list.

- Clear Items Option:
Users can reset their Todo List by emptying it out.
